# 🌱 Plant Disease Classification using CNN 🌿

## 📚 Project Overview
This project aims to classify plant leaf diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. Accurate disease detection helps farmers take timely preventive measures and improve crop yield.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a CNN model to classify various plant diseases.
- Achieve high accuracy using transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- Provide a web interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

---

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – For building and training the CNN model  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Flask/Streamlit** – Web interface (optional, if deployed)  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)  
- The dataset contains labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves across multiple plant species.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Input Layer:** 224x224 RGB image  
- **Conv Layers:** Multiple convolution and pooling layers to extract features  
- **Flatten Layer:** Converts matrix to vector  
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Dense layers for classification  
- **Output Layer:** Softmax for multi-class classification  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   - Image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.  
   - Split dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Build CNN architecture or use a pre-trained model (VGG16, ResNet).  
   - Compile and fit the model.

3. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate model accuracy and fine-tune if necessary.  

4. **Deployment (Optional):**  
   - Build a Flask or Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
